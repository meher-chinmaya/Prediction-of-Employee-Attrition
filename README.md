# Employee-Attrition - Classification
The objective of this project was to predict the rate of employee attrition in the current scenario based on different features. It was the classification problem. I performed EDA, Feature Scaling, Feature Engineering and applied Logistics Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest for prediction.I got high accuracy score about 0.97 using random Forest.

# Steps:
  * Import Libraries and read data set
  * Describe the dataset
  * Data Transforamtion / Categorical to Numerical
  * Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
  * Split the dataset into train and test set
  * Machine Learning Modeling
  * train the model (Fit)
  * Test the trained model (prediction )
  * Model Evaluation
  *Model Deployment Using Gradio
